                     Installing C-XSC (CToolbox included)
                     ===================================

Note: the formerly separated CToolbox routines are now part of C-XSC itself.
Thus only one library libcxsc.a or libcxsc.so will be created by this 
installation process.   
  
The C-XSC release 2.2.3 works on
   - Linux with GNU C++ compiler gcc 3.2/3.3/3.3.2/3.4/4.x/4.1.0/4.2.1
   - Linux with Intel C++ compiler Version 7.1/8.0/8.1
   - x86_64 systems (AMD64 architectur, e.g. AMD Opteron) with
     Linux and GNU C++ compiler (64 bit code)
   - ia64 systems (e.g. Intel Itanium) with GNU C++-compiler
     and Intel-Compiler (64 bit)
   - MS Windows with MS Visual Studio 2005 Compiler (Express Edition)
     URL: http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/download/
     --> For convenience please use the pre-compiled special edition of 
         C-XSC with an installer program from 
         URL: http://www.math.uni-wuppertal.de/~xsc/
   - MS Windows with Cygwin
   - Mac OS/X systems ("Darwin") with G4 processor (32 bit)
     (primary support for i386 architecture)  
   - IBM AIX 5.2 with Power4+ processor  (64 bit)
   - SUN Solaris with SUN Forte Developer 7 C++ 5.4 /
                      SUN ONE Studio8 C++ 5.5 /
                      SUN Studio 9 C++ 5.6 /
		      SUN Studio 10 C++ 5.7
   - SUN Solaris with gcc 3.2/3.3/3.3.2/3.4/4.0.0/4.0.2 
     (probably not all configuration options are supported with your
     solaris-system; if you have problems test "software emulation (soft)"
     and "static library (static)" or use the SUN Compiler)

Important:
----------
Do not use C-XSC with "gcc version 3.3 20030226 (prerelease) (SuSE Linux)"
from the SuSE Linux 8.2 distribution. This compiler version has serious 
bugs. If you use SuSE Linux 8.2 please update your compiler with
the rpm-packages from SuSE: http://sdb.suse.de/en/sdb/html/gcc33_release.html

Maybe with gcc version 3.0.1 you get an internal compiler error 
(segmentation fault). In this case please use a newer version of gcc. 
 
 
Installation:
=============

   1. Unpack the sources cxsc-2-2-3.tar.gz : 
           gunzip cxsc-2-2-3.tar.gz
           tar xvf cxsc-2-2-3.tar
     
      If you use cygwin do not unpack the sources in your home directory,
      use another directory e.g. c:\tmp
  
      This creates a directory ./cxsc with all the necessary files and
      subdirectories.

            cxsc                (includes: README, install, changelog)
              |
              +-- docu          (documentation)
              |
              +-- examples      (some small examples)
	      |
	      +-- CToolbox      (C-XSC Toolbox Modules and Programs)
	      |
	      +-- benchmark     (a simple benchmark program)
	      |
	      +-- scripts       (some scripts, e.g. for RPM packages)
              |
              +-- win32         (some files for MS Visual C++ compiler)
              |
              +-- src           (C++ source code of C-XSC)
                   |
                   +-- fi_lib   (C source code, elementary functions)
                   |
                   +-- rts      (C source code, run time system)

   2. Compile all sources:

           cd ./cxsc; 
           ./install_cxsc
      
      For configuration please answer the questions from the install
      script. After that the script creates the library libcxsc.a and
      all program examples from the toolbox library (without any 
      optimization of the code). 
      Also a test program is compiled and started.   
  

Using C-XSC (including CToolbox)
================================

When you compile and link code using C-XSC routines (or CToolbox routines), 
you have to define the C-XSC include path and the C-XSC library path 
and you have to link the library  libcxsc.a:

     g++ -I<include path> -L<library path> prog.cpp -lcxsc -o prog

Depending on the actual choice of some parameters during the installation
process further libraries have to be linked (e.g. -lm or -lm9x). 

Using a makefile is described in the file Makefile.example in the 
examples subdirectory. Also some sample programs can be found in this 
subdirectory.

Since C-XSC Version 2.1 the C-XSC routines and the CToolbox routines
are available in the common library libcxsc.a (or the corresponding
dynamic link library libcxsc.so, respectively).
 

Uninstalling C-XSC
==================

To uninstall C-XSC, simply type
   cd $(PREFIX)/cxsc      # $(PREFIX) is the installation prefix
                          #   defined in the file Makefile
   gmake uninstall      

This undoes the effect of gmake install, which is implicitly executed
by install_cxsc. Note that the source tree is not removed. 
So all sources are still available.
